# verbes_irreguliers_francais

This app was made for foreign students willing to study French language. It includes several functionalities to simplify irregular verbs learning.

These functionalities are:
- checking verbs forms;
- learning verbs through a learning program;
- revising custom elements.

The development process was started in August 2025 when my coding level was not the best: some things might look a bit sketchy.
